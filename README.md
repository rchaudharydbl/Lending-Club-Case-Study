# Lending-Club-Case-Study
The purpose of Lending Club Case Study is to assess the risk associated with the loan approval decision and to identify the cause that lead a borrower to default on a loan.

The study will facilitate the Consumer finance company to make correct risk assessment decisions.

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

The analysis will eventually help in mitigating the risk of issuing loans that borrower have high potential to default.
